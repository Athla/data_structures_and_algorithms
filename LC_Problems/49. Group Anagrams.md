Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = [""]
**Output:** [[""]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = ["a"]
**Output:** [["a"]]

**Solution:**
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        l = len(strs)
        seen = {}
        a = []
        for i in range(l):
            w = "".join(sorted(strs[i]))
            if w in seen:
                a[seen[w]].append(strs[i])
            else:
                seen[w] = len(a)
                a.append([strs[i]])
        
        return a
```

# Explanation:
    - Iterate through the array sorting the words, check if the sorted word is at a hash map, if not, add the len of the current answer array to seen map, where the key is the sorted word
    - if word is at the hashmap, append the current word unsorted to the answer array at the length of the word idx
