# Hello, world?

## Purpose of this repository.
- This repository will serve as a timeline/tracker of my progress learning Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Why?
- Being a self taught developer, I first learned how to solve problems, but did not learn the basics and fundamental parts of a language.
- Because of that, I deemed needed that I learned it to improve my current skills.
- This repository will, for sure, contain solutions, implementations and leet code problems that I've solved.

## I stumbled upon here and want to help. How can I do it?
